# NSL-KDD-Network-Intrusion-Detection

## About

In this project, attack detection is performed with machine learning algorithms on the NSL-KDD dataset. Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier from machine learning algorithms were used. In addition, classification was made with all models as Ensemble Learning. Accuracy comparisons of all models were made.

In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to intrusion detection on NSL-KDD dataset. Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier are used as machine learning algorithms. In addition, all models were classified as Ensemble Learning. Accuracy comparisons of all models were performed.
